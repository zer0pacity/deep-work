# deep-work

DeepWork is a MS Teams-integrated App that is built using PowerApp platform.
This section of the program is focused on building individual schedules for each employee, and allowing them to see overall progress of the works they have to do.

The first screen asks you about what 'type' will your schedule be.
You can choose 'Structure' option to get a fully structured schedule, or 'Flexible' option fo get a customizable schedule.

You can return to the first screen or explore other features using the side menu, which is accesible via clicking on the hamburger menu icon.

The 'Schedule' section is where the confirmed schedule of each individual(it means you) gets placed. Currently that feature is not added, leaving only the title in its screen.

The 'Major Progress' section is where you can see the overall progress of work initiated by various employees.
The 'Leaderboard' section is where you can see the leaderboard of employees, sorted by their 'score', which is gained by one by fulfilling a work.

'Preferences' section is not activated nor implemented as there is no useful options for users to manipulate.
